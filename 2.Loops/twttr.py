"""
When texting or tweeting, itâ€™s not uncommon to shorten words to save time or space, as by omitting vowels, 
much like Twitter was originally called twttr. In a file called twttr.py, implement a program that prompts 
the user for a str of text and then outputs that same text but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, 
whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.

user_input = input("Input: ")

print("Output: ", end="")

for c in user_input:
    if c.lower() in ['a','e','i','o','u']:
        print("",end = "")
    else:
        print(c,end = "")
print()
