In a file called interpreter.py, implement a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression 
and then calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place.
Assume that the userâ€™s input will be formatted as x y z, 
with one space between x and y and one space between y and z, wherein:

x is an integer
y is +, -, *, or /
z is an integer
